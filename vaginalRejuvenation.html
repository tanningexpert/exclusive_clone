        <h2>How does vaginal rejuvenation work?​</h2>
        <p>Vaginal rejuvenation is the perfect choice for anyone looking to improve the appearance, health, and functionality of their vagina. This gentle procedure uses radiofrequency energy to tighten tissue and stimulate the production of collagen. Through this uniform RF heating, Votiva achieves the desired stimulation of elastin and collagen production and an increase in blood flow. When those three parameters are stimulated, the result is increased vaginal lubrication and elasticity, elimination of urinary incontinence, and tightening of the vaginal walls.</p>
        <h2>​What Should I Expect During Treatment?</h2> 
            <p> The treatment is painless and most women report a warm sensation during the process and compare the feeling to that of a hot stone massage. Some of them mention slight discomfort comparable to an annual gynecological exam when the probe is inserted into the vagina.
            <br>
            First, ultrasound gel is applied to the head of the FormaV wand and is heated to 35 C.
            <br>
            Next, the wand is inserted into the vaginal canal to measure its length and ensure precise and efficient treatment. ​
            <br>
            The wand is then passed over the internal tissues from proximal to distal and is carefully rotated during treatment to allow the heat to be evenly distributed and to ensure symmetrical results.
            <br>
            Each treatment session typically lasts 30 minutes, but the exact length of a Votiva treatment will ultimately depend on the specifics discussed during the consultation.
            </p>
        <h2>How quickly will I see results?</h2> 
            <p>Patients can typically begin to see skin tightening improvements in the hours following treatment with results continuing to be seen in the coming weeks as additional collagen fibers are gradually stimulated and remodeled.                 
            </p>       
        <h2>How much downtime?</h2>       
            <p>There is little to no downtime and patients may resume their daily activities immediately after completing a Votiva treatment. The most reported side effects from some patients are that they may see slight redness in the treated area, which will subside within a few hours.
            <br>
            It is advisable that patients wait approximately 1 week before having intercourse to allow for optimal healing.

            </p>
        <h2>Is Votiva safe?</h2>
        <p>The FormaV applicator is the only device that monitors the vaginal lining temperatures and cuts off the temperature and sustains the end point automatically during the treatment, preventing over-heating and burns, but also ensuring the best possible tightening .The sustained, gentle, non-painful heat results in remodeling of the vaginal mucosa and sub-mucosal tissues with increased tightening and mucosal secretions.
        </p>

      <h2>Am I a Good Candidate?</h2>
      <p>Votiva is a groundbreaking form of non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation that can tighten loose skin, improve vaginal aesthetics, and enhance satisfaction during intercourse. You may want to consider that Votiva procedure if your vagina and the surrounding muscles have altered and stretched due to aging, pregnancy, or weight loss.
    
    <br>
    A consultation with our team is the best way to determine if this treatment is a good fit for you and your goals. As a series of treatments may be necessary to achieve the best results, we can also help you develop your customized treatment plan.

      <h2>Surgery vs. Votiva</h2>
      <p>Votiva is the first and only FDA approved device for vaginal rejuvenation and it is safe and effective for feminine concerns like:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stress urinary incontinence
            </li>
            <li>Weakened pelvic muscles
            </li>
            <li>Decreased sensitivity and low blood flow
            </li>
            <li>Vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse
            </li>
            <li>Wrinkled appearance and loss of elasticity of the vulva and labia
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the past, traditional vaginal surgery was the only solution to address these unwanted effects, but technological advancements have led to exciting and effective non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation options that allow patients to avoid the surgical risks and downtime of vaginoplasty and labiaplasty.
